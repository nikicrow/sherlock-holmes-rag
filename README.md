# Basic RAG using pdf

I wanted to see how hard it was going to be to make a RAG using the open source Sherlock Holmes Novels!

The deployed app is here https://nikicrow-sherlock-holmes-rag-app-ybxqcz.streamlit.app/

It's pretty easy and actually pretty good.

I used this blog post https://blog.streamlit.io/build-a-chatbot-with-custom-data-sources-powered-by-llamaindex/

Note: it seems to cost about 10 cents to do the embedding.
